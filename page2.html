      <h1>Understanding the fundamentals of state in Javascript</h1>
      <p id="pa">Designed by insert-your-name-here</p>
      <p id="pa">
        Chapter 3 from the book; Vumbula React — Co-authored by John Kagga
      </p>
      <p id="pa">
        In earlier chapters, we’ve dealt mostly with functional React components
        that do not require state management. This chapter’s main focus is on
        state, its management and components that utilise it in React.
      </p>
      <h1>What is State?</h1>
      <p id="pa">
        State is a JavaScript object that stores a component’s dynamic data and
        determines the component’s behaviour. Because state is dynamic, it
        enables a component to keep track of changing information in between
        renders and for it to be dynamic and interactive.
      </p>

      <p id="pa">
        State is similar to props but unlike props, it is private to a component
        and is controlled solely by the said component. In the examples from
        previous chapters, the behaviour of components has primarily depended on
        the props that are passed down to them. In those cases, the components
        that receive the props have no control over them because props are
        read-only.
      </p>

      <h1>Adding State to a Class Component</h1>
      class Greeting extends React.Component {<br />
      render(){<br />
      return
      <h1>I’m a component in need of some state!</h1>
      ;<br />
      }<br />
      }<br />

      Adding state to the Greeting component above involves defining within the
      class component, a constructor function that assigns the initial state
      using this.state.<br />

      class Greeting extends React.Component {<br />
      constructor(props) {<br />
      super(props);<br />
      // Define your state object here<br />
      this.state = {<br />
      name: ‘Jane Doe’<br />
      }<br />
      }<br />
      render(){<br />
      return Hello { this.state.name }<br />
      ;<br />> }<br />
      <h1>Investigating State using React Dev Tools</h1>
      <p id="pa">
        The devtools are available for download on both Mozilla Firefox Add-ons
        and the Chrome Web Store. Follow the appropriate link to install the
        devtools depending on which browser you have installed on your computer.
      </p>

      <p id="pa">
        Throughout the rest of this book, Chrome will be used as the browser of
        choice. In order to confirm successful installation of the devtools on
        Chrome, open the developer tools window using Cmd+Opt+I on a Mac or
        Ctrl+Alt+I on a windows PC. You should now see a React tab.
